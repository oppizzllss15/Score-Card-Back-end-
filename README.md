## Overall Objective
To build a digital platform where Decagon engineers in training (known as Decadevs) can view their weekly performance report and also get evaluation based on skill based test taken on the platform. The digital engineer scorecard is an improvement to the current process.

## Problem Statement
The current process of sharing Decadev’s weekly performance with the Decadevs involves manually screenshotting the particular decadev record from the tracker and sending it via email or chat to the Decadev. This is because the decadevs are only to be aware of their own performance and not the performance of the other Decadevs. This is usually a time consuming and boring exercise for whoever is tasked with taking screenshots and sharing them with Decadevs. Previous screenshots can also get lost in chats and might never be referred to by the Decadev as the training progresses which defeats part of its purpose.

Imagine a process where no one has to take and share screenshots every week to the Decadevs because the Decadevs can  view their current and previous week's grades by logging into their scorecard. The decadevs can also take skill based tests to keep track of skill proficiency level as the program progresses.
Not only is this less stressful, it is a more effective way for decadevs to also monitor and track their performance..

The Decadev logs  into the application and views the weekly performance result for that week while also has the option to compare the recent performance records against past performance records. The Decadev can also take the skill test to get evaluation on their skill level .
 
## Product Scope
- Extract Decadev record from performance Review process
- A change in how decadevs take their growth process 
- A change in how progress is tracked
